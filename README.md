## What is Crux Garden?

Crux Garden is a model of how ideas manifest and develop over time. The heart of the model is the **Crux**, an atomic representation of an idea. In our implementation, a Crux can be text, media, code, or any digital content worth preserving. But Cruxes, just like ideas, don't exist in isolation. Ideas have origins. They lead to new ideas. They evolve. And often, they randomly connect. So it is with Cruxes. In Crux Garden, there are four types of relationships Cruxes can have with each other. These are called **Dimensions**:

- **GATES** — Cruxes which influenced or inspired a Crux; its origins and sources.
- **GARDENS** — Cruxes which emerged or grew from a Crux, its creations and consequences.
- **GROWTH** — How a Crux developed over time, its transformation and refinement.
- **GRAFTS** — Cruxes which connect to a Crux laterally, its associations and resonances.

These four Dimensions capture the fundamental ways that Cruxes, or ideas, relate to one another.

The power of a system that models ideas at such a primitive scale is that literally any idea or framework of ideas can be realized inside Crux Garden: interactive fiction with evolving storylines, personal knowledge bases connecting insights across domains, product development roadmaps linking requirements to releases, research systems tracking citations and discoveries, or anything else where ideas have origins, consequences, transformation, and connection.

Along with Cruxes and Dimensions, there are several other types including Tags, Themes, and Paths. See the database schema in `db/schema.sql` or the API documentation at `/docs` for details.
